 * Windows
    * Be sure to run `npm install windows-build-tools --global` from an elevated prompt (as an administrator) to install windows-build-tools. 

 1. Fork this repository on Github
 2. Make a clone of the created fork repository: `git clone https://github.com/youruser/photon.git`
 3. Create a branch to commit your feature or fix: `git checkout -b my-branch`
 4. Make sure to use `yarn` to install all dependencies

You can test the cli using: `yarn ts-node ./cli/index.ts <args>`

## When you're done, make your Pull Request!
 * Commit the changes: `yarn commit`
 * Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin my-branch`
 * Go to Pull Requests from the root repository and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/TeamDock/photon/pulls) with your commit(s)
